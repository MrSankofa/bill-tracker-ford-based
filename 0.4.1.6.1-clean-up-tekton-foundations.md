### Clean up old PipelineRuns and pods (keep only what you need)

Why do we do this?
Tekton creates a lot of artifacts. If you don’t clean them, you end up debugging the wrong run, reading old logs, and losing hours. Clean cluster state is clarity.

Step A: List all PipelineRuns

```bash
kubectl get pipelinerun --sort-by=.metadata.creationTimestamp
```

Step B: Delete the failed runs (Keep your latest green run if you want to)

# list failed
```kubectl get pipelinerun --no-headers | awk '$2=="False" {print $1}'```

# delete the failed ones (verify list above before running)
```kubectl get pipelinerun --no-headers | awk '$2=="False" {print $1}' | xargs -I{} kubectl delete pipelinerun {}```


Delete leftover pods (optional, but recommended)

```bash
kubectl delete pod -l tekton.dev/pipelineRun
```
This deletes all pods created by Tekton PipelineRuns. Tekton automatically cleans up pods when PipelineRuns are deleted, but if you have many failed or old PipelineRuns, some pods may remain. Deleting them helps keep your cluster clean.

### Alignment Test

```shell
kubectl get pipelinerun
kubectl get pods | grep bill-tracker-backend-test || true
```
Make sure only the PipelineRuns and pods you want to keep are present.
